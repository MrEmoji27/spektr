    Frequency runs bottom-to-top and time scrolls right-to-left, which is the

    display unreadable to anyone who has seen one before.

    The scroll is paced in **columns per second**, not columns per frame.
    Shifting a fixed one column per frame — which this did originally — makes
    the time axis mean whatever the current frame rate happens to be: measured
    at a 4x spread, with one second of audio occupying 30 columns at 30 fps
    against 120 at 120 fps. That also breaks the promise the settings panel
    makes about frame rate ("the motion is timed in seconds, so this changes
    smoothness only"), and it interacts badly with the adaptive pacer in
    widget.py, which retimes fps by +/-6 at runtime: the waterfall visibly
    slowed down and sped back up as the pacer moved, with nothing in the audio
    changing. The fractional remainder is carried in scratch rather than
    rounded away, so a rate that isn't a whole number of columns per frame
    still averages out exactly instead of drifting.

    make_strips run-length-encodes on the (fg, bg) *pair*, not a single index,
    and this field crossed enough ramp buckets per column that most rows were
    forty-odd tiny segments instead of a handful of long ones — 10-11 ms of
    make_strips alone at 400x100, the actual bottleneck, confirmed by profiling
    that isolated it from this function's own ~2 ms. The fix isn't giving up
    the two-colour trick; it's that the swirl frequencies (6/5/4/14 cycles
    across the field) were higher than the terminal's own resolution could
    usefully show — a colour changing several times a *column* reads as noise,
    not gradient, on top of costing real time to encode. Halved, it reads as

    Plasma is a smooth continuous field; this is the opposite kind of
    pattern — an interference figure with hard nodal lines, the shape sand
    takes on a real Chladni plate, where it collects at the nodes (zero
    motion) and gets shaken off everywhere else. The two integer mode
    numbers that decide the figure's shape track the spectrum's centre of
    mass, so a bass-heavy passage gives a coarse few-line figure and a
    bright treble-heavy one gives a dense, many-celled figure — the same way
    sweeping a real plate's drive frequency snaps it between resonant
    figures. Loudness sharpens the lines rather than moving them, the way a
    harder-driven plate throws sand into tighter bands.

    Two things here exist only to keep make_strips cheap, the same lesson
    Plasma's docstring already tells: this uses the same two-colour ``▀``
    trick, and unlike Plasma's smooth field, ``nodal`` is a sharp,
    non-monotonic difference-of-products — measured at ~50 distinct ramp
    values per row at 400x100, versus Plasma's handful, because the
    interference pattern has many local extrema even at low mode numbers.
    ``m``/``n`` are capped lower than a "real" Chladni figure would use
    (halving them only cut cost by ~15%, so frequency wasn't the main
    driver), and ``nodal`` is quantised to 10 buckets before ramping so
    neighbouring pixels collapse into the same colour index more often. That
    combination measured worst-case ~7ms at 400x100, down from ~9-14ms and
    frequently over the 11ms slow-mode threshold — which read as exactly the
    "pops up, lags, then catches up" pattern it was reported as, since
    crossing that threshold makes the widget reuse every other frame.
