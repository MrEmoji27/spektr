    The scroll is paced in **columns per second**, not columns per frame.
    Shifting a fixed one column per frame — which this did originally — makes
    the time axis mean whatever the current frame rate happens to be: measured
    at a 4x spread, with one second of audio occupying 30 columns at 30 fps
    against 120 at 120 fps. That also breaks the promise the settings panel
    makes about frame rate ("the motion is timed in seconds, so this changes

    widget.py, which retimes fps by +/-6 at runtime: the waterfall visibly
    slowed down and sped back up as the pacer moved, with nothing in the audio

    Plasma is a smooth continuous field; this is the opposite kind of
    pattern — an interference figure with hard nodal lines, the shape sand
    takes on a real Chladni plate, where it collects at the nodes (zero
    motion) and gets shaken off everywhere else. The two integer mode
    numbers that decide the figure's shape track the spectrum's centre of
    mass, so a bass-heavy passage gives a coarse few-line figure and a
    bright treble-heavy one gives a dense, many-celled figure — the same way
    sweeping a real plate's drive frequency snaps it between resonant
    figures. Loudness sharpens the lines rather than moving them, the way a
    harder-driven plate throws sand into tighter bands.

    This is the discrete, physical one: it holds a figure and jumps to the
    next. See ``Chladni Extreme`` for the version that morphs continuously
    between them and escalates as a track sustains energy.

    Two things here exist only to keep make_strips cheap, the same lesson
    Plasma's docstring already tells: this uses the same two-colour ``▀``
    trick, and unlike Plasma's smooth field, ``nodal`` is a sharp,
    non-monotonic difference-of-products — measured at ~50 distinct ramp
    values per row at 400x100, versus Plasma's handful, because the
    interference pattern has many local extrema even at low mode numbers.
    ``m``/``n`` are capped lower than a "real" Chladni figure would use
    (halving them only cut cost by ~15%, so frequency wasn't the main
    driver), and ``nodal`` is quantised to 10 buckets before ramping so
    neighbouring pixels collapse into the same colour index more often. That
    combination measured worst-case ~7ms at 400x100, down from ~9-14ms and
    frequently over the 11ms slow-mode threshold — which read as exactly the
    "pops up, lags, then catches up" pattern it was reported as, since

    Three differences, in order of how much they matter.

    **The modes are continuous.** ``Chladni`` snaps between whole mode numbers
    because that is what a plate physically does. This sweeps the fractional
    values in between, so one figure melts into the next instead of cutting to
    it. Physically nonsense; it is the more hypnotic picture, and keeping both
    is why this mode exists separately rather than replacing the other.

    **It escalates.** A ``charge`` builds while the track stays energetic and
    bleeds away when it doesn't, over about eight seconds either way. Nothing
    about the current frame's level can shortcut it — a single loud hit will
    not buy the escalated look, and a quiet bar will not immediately lose it.
    What charge buys, progressively: a second interference term at double the
    mode numbers folds in, so the figure gains fine structure inside its own
    cells; the plate spins faster; and the nodal lines tighten. Fully charged
    it is a dense, fast, high-contrast figure that a plate at rest never
    reaches. That is the "progressively better" part — the mode rewards a
    track that keeps going rather than resetting every bar.

    **It reacts harder.** Easing is 0.35s -> 0.12s so the figure chases the
    spectrum instead of drifting after it, and the mode range is wider at both
    ends.

    The cost notes in ``Chladni``'s docstring still apply, with one addition:
    the harmonic term is four more transcendentals over the field, so it is
    computed **only when charge is actually up** rather than multiplied by
    zero. At rest this mode costs what ``Chladni`` costs.
